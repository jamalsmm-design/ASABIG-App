KPI Name,Age Group(s),Gender,Measurement Method,Description,Why This Matters (Justification),Expected Trend by Age,Input Owner
Standing Height,7–23 (all),M/F,Manual or Device (stadiometer),Full body height in cm,"Used to understand growth pattern, sport suitability (e.g., basketball vs. gymnastics), and maturity timing.","Rapid increase 10–15, then slows; girls reach adult height earlier (≈14–16) than boys (≈16–18).",Athlete / Guardian
Sitting Height,7–23,M/F,Device,Height while seated,Helps separate leg vs. trunk length and estimate maturity offset with PHV.,Increases with growth; ratio to standing height stabilizes after PHV.,Medical / Coach
Arm Span,7–23,M/F,Manual or Device,Fingertip-to-fingertip distance,"Indicates leverage and suitability for sports like swimming, basketball, throwing events.",Often slightly larger than height in late teens; useful for talent orientation.,Coach
Body Weight,7–23,M/F,Device (scale),Weight in kg,Combined with height to monitor healthy growth and training impact.,Should follow healthy centile curves; big sudden jumps need monitoring.,Athlete / Clinic
Body Mass Index (BMI),10–23,M/F,Calculated,Weight / height²,"Not a selection tool, but helps identify under/over-nutrition that can affect performance.",Should stay in healthy range; interpretation adjusted by age & sport.,System (Auto)
PHV Age (Peak Height Velocity),11–18,M/F,Medical / Growth Calculator,Estimated age at peak growth spurt,Crucial to avoid misjudging late/early maturers and to time high-load training phases.,"Occurs ~12 for girls, ~14 for boys; used to tag “pre-, circa-, post-PHV”.",Medical
Biological Age Offset,11–18,M/F,Medical,Difference between biological and chronological age,Prevents unfair comparison between early and late maturers in selection decisions.,"Early = +, Late = −; used for fair benchmarking of performance.",Medical
Fundamental Movement Score,7–12,M/F,Coach Field Assessment,"Composite score of run, jump, throw, catch, balance",Good movers learn sport skills faster; foundation for all sports.,Should improve strongly 7–12; plateau if not trained.,Coach
Core Stability Rating,10–23,M/F,"Field Test (planks, holds)",Ability to maintain trunk control,"Protects from injury and supports performance in all movements (sprint, change of direction, jumps).",Increases with age and training; red flags if very low vs peers.,Coach
Training Age (Years of Sport),7–23,M/F,Manual (questionnaire),Number of years doing organized sport,Helps differentiate between “new talent” and “experienced athlete” at same chronological age.,Higher training age should correlate with better technical/tactical level.,Athlete / Guardian
Weekly Training Load (hrs),10–23,M/F,Manual,Sum of structured training hours per week,Used to monitor over/under-training and interpret performance and injury risk.,Should increase gradually; sudden spikes increase injury risk.,Athlete / Coach
Sleep Duration (avg hrs/night),10–23,M/F,Manual,Average nightly sleep,"Strong link with recovery, learning, and performance; chronic low sleep harms talent development.","Target 9–11 hrs for 7–13, 8–10 hrs for teens, 7–9 for 18+.",Athlete / Guardian
Perceived Motivation Score,10–23,M/F,Questionnaire (Likert scale),Self-rated internal motivation to train/compete,Motivation is a key predictor of long-term engagement and progression.,Should stay medium–high; repeated very low scores signal risk of dropout.,Athlete
Concentration / Focus Rating,10–23,M/F,Simple cognitive test / survey,Ability to maintain focus during tasks or games,Important across all sports; linked to decision-making quality and error rate.,Should improve with age and experience; low scores trigger cognitive support.,Coach / Psych
Injury History Flag,7–23,M/F,Manual + Medical,Record of significant injuries (type/date),"Needed to individualize training, reduce re-injury risk, and interpret test results properly.",Should guide load management; repeated similar injuries require intervention.,Athlete / Medical
